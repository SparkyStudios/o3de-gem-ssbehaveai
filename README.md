# Behave AI

An AI toolkit for O3DE.

Behave is a package used as a starting point to implement AI capabilites in O3DE projects. Currently, it provides two main features:

- A BehaviorTree engine, built on top of BehaviorTree.CPP.
- [WIP] A 2D Navigation and Path Finding, built on top of Recast Navigation.
